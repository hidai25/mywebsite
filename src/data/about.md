# Intro

I am an AI/ML engineer and software developer with a strong foundation in quantitative finance. I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, from LLM-powered applications to data-driven trading strategies. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to create impactful products.

# Currently

Building AI-powered applications and evaluation frameworks while working as a trader at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank in Tel-Aviv. I focus on applying machine learning and large language models to both financial markets and software products.

# Background

With over 15 years of experience in quantitative finance across major institutions including Fortis Bank and Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, I've developed a unique perspective on applying technology to complex problems. My transition into software engineering through Harvard Extension School has enabled me to bridge the gap between domain expertise and modern AI/ML capabilities.

# What I Build

- **LLM Applications**: End-to-end systems using OpenAI, LangChain, and RAG architectures
- **ML Pipelines**: Production-grade machine learning workflows for prediction and analysis
- **Data Products**: Full-stack applications that turn data into actionable insights
- **Evaluation Tools**: Frameworks for measuring and improving AI system performance

# Education

- **Harvard Extension School** - Master of Liberal Arts, Software Engineering (2023)
- **University of Liege, Belgium** - B.A. Economical Sciences (2006)

# Technical Focus

My current technical interests center around building reliable AI systems: prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, model evaluation, and deploying ML models at scale. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and financial technology.
